abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive study of structural additive theory, which is also variously known as additive combinatorics, additive number theory, additive group theory, and combinatorial number theory. The text focuses on fundamental aspects of additive theory and contains detail-rich proofs, making the material more accessible to both researchers in the field as well as newcomers.},
