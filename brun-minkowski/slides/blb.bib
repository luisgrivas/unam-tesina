abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive study of structural additive theory, which is also variously known as additive combinatorics, additive number theory, additive group theory, and combinatorial number theory. The text focuses on fundamental aspects of additive theory and contains detail-rich proofs, making the material more accessible to both researchers in the field as well as newcomers.},

abstract = {We give tight lower bounds on the cardinality of the sumset of two finite, nonempty subsets A,B⊆R2 in terms of the minimum number h1(A,B) of parallel lines covering each of A and B. We show that, if h1(A,B)⩾s and |A|⩾|B|⩾2s2−3s+2, then|A+B|⩾|A|+(3−2s)|B|−2s+1. More precise estimations are given under different assumptions on |A| and |B|. This extends the 2-dimensional case of the Freiman 2d-Theorem to distinct sets A and B, and, in the symmetric case A=B, improves the best prior known bound for |A|=|B| (due to Stanchescu, and which was cubic in s) to an exact value. As part of the proof, we give general lower bounds for two-dimensional subsets that improve the two-dimensional case of estimates of Green and Tao and of Gardner and Gronchi, related to the Brunn–Minkowski Theorem.}
